                    I help building a shopping app used by companies in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The challenge is to create an extensible and flexible multi-client platform app. We use the Redux-Architecture with <a href="https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift">ReSwift</a> to ensure a fast implementation time of upcoming features. The app takes advantage of various tools such as UIKit, XCTest, CoreData, Foundation, Fastlane (CI) and Alamofire (Networking). My responsibilities are improving the architectural structure, the API-Layer and software-quality.

As JEE software developer I was responsible for the technical implementation of payment transaction processes. The major goal of this task was to create a reliable solution to ensure failsafe payment transaction between multiple Web-Shops and international Payment Service Providers.
During the time at Habermaaß I gained the basic skills in clean OSGi application development.

                        During my apprenticeship at Habermaaß GmbH I got deep insights in the development of Java Enterprise Applications. Beside the development of responsive Web Applications I gained knowledge in software development principles such as test driven development, design patterns, software architecture, web services and functional programming. During trainings and educational projects I got an introduction in low-level programming such as compiler engineering, JNI and concurrency.
